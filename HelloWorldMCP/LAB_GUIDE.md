## üìã Prerequisites

- C# programming knowledge
- .NET 8.0 SDK installed
- **VS Code** with **GitHub Copilot** extension
- **MCP extension** for VS Code (install from marketplace)
- Basic understanding of ETL traces (helpful but not required)

## üöÄ Lab Setup

### Step 1: Configure VS Code MCP Integration

1. **Install the MCP extension** in VS Code
2. **Configure the MCP server** in your global MCP configuration:
   - Open VS Code Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
   - Search for "MCP: Edit Configuration"
   - Add the HelloWorldMCP server to your `mcp.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "servers": {
    "hello-world-lab": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": ["run", "--project", "HelloWorldMCP.csproj"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/HelloWorldMCP"
    }
  },
  "inputs": []
}
```

**Note**: Replace `/path/to/your/HelloWorldMCP` with the actual path to your HelloWorldMCP project directory. Examples:
- Windows: `"C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\source\\repos\\HelloWorldMCP"`
- macOS/Linux: `"/home/username/projects/HelloWorldMCP"`

**Alternative**: If you have other MCP servers configured, add the `hello-world-lab` entry to your existing `servers` object.

### Step 2: Build and Start the MCP Server

1. **Build the project**: `dotnet build`
2. **Restart VS Code** to reload the MCP configuration
3. **Verify MCP server connection**: Open Copilot Chat and ask:
   ```
   What MCP tools are available?
   ```
4. **Check for HelloWorldMCP tools** - you should see: HelloWorld, GetSystemInfo, AnalyzeTrace, GetProcessCpuUsage

### Exercise 5.2: Extending the Lab (Optional Challenge)

**Objective**: Create a 4th endpoint following the established patterns

**Challenge**: Add a `ValidateTraceFile` endpoint that checks if a file is a valid ETL trace:

```csharp
[McpServerTool, Description("Validate if a file is a valid ETL trace")]
public static object ValidateTraceFile(string tracePath)
{
    // Your implementation here:
    // 1. Check file exists
    // 2. Check file extension
    // 3. Try to open with TraceProcessor (catch exceptions)
    // 4. Return validation result with details
}
```

**Test your implementation with Copilot**:
```
@workspace Use the new ValidateTraceFile tool to check if my file is a valid ETL trace
```

### Exercise 5.2: Enhanced Error Reporting
